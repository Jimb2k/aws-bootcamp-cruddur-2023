## Homework Challenges

### Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile

I've done an assessment via the free open source tool snyk, and I've found a lot of vulnerabilities

![Snyk Assessment](/_docs/assets/Week1-Snyk-Assessment.png)

A pull request was created through Snyk and I accepted it from Github --> upgrading image base to latest version

![Snyk Pull request](/_docs/assets/Week1-Snyk-pull-request.png)

With this action all the critical vulnerabilities was corrected
